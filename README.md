This project utilizes Power BI to analyze customer churn data for a bank, aiming to identify patterns and insights that can help reduce churn rates and improve customer retention strategies. The dataset includes fields such as Customer ID, Age, Gender, Geography, Tenure, Balance, Number of Products, Credit Card Ownership, Active Membership Status, Estimated Salary, and whether the customer has exited. The objectives are to visualize the churn rate and its distribution, identify key factors contributing to churn, and provide actionable insights and recommendations. To get started, clone the repository and open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop. The dashboards include features such as Churn Rate, Churn by Gender, Age Group, Geography, Tenure, Account Balance, Number of Products, Credit Card Ownership, Active Membership, and Estimated Salary. This analysis aims to help banks implement targeted strategies to improve customer retention.
